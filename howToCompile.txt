Install mingw
Install SFML 2.1

Aren't there makefiles for Windows? That would be nice.

Main program:
If you installed SFML 2.1 in for example c:/User/SFML2.1 then you compile like this
gcc main.cpp board.cpp game.cpp piece.cpp position.cpp networking.cpp -o TCPChess.exe -Lc:/user/SFML2.1/lib -Ic:/user/SFML2.1/include -lsfml-system -lsfml-network -Wall -lstdc++


Unit Tests:
gcc board.cpp piece.cpp position.cpp pieceTest.cpp -o PieceTest.exe -Wall -lstdc++

Release build for people without Mingw:
gcc main.cpp board.cpp game.cpp piece.cpp position.cpp networking.cpp -o "Release/TCPChess-1.0.exe" -Lc:/user/SFML2.1/lib -Ic:/user/SFML2.1/include -lsfml-system -lsfml-network -Wall -lstdc++
